  aboutMe: 'After working for several years in the veterinary field, I decided to make a change in my professional life. I was looking for a career where I could learn every day, where I would be valued and where there would be a wide range of job opportunities. That’s when I got to know the world of web programming. I discovered how amazing it is to create anything with a language other than what we are used to. I was captivated by the logic needed to make everything work, as well as the organization of the code and the use of creativity to get new features.',
